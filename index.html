            <p id="title4">Pablo Picasso is one of the most famous artists in the world, and his artwork has been admired and celebrated for centuries. His works have been displayed in galleries and museums around the globe and his influence is still seen in modern art today.

                Pablo Picasso was born in 1881 in Spain and grew up in Barcelona. He studied art from an early age and became an apprentice in the late 1890s. Picasso quickly began to develop his own style of painting which was inspired by a variety of influences, including African and Iberian art, as well as the work of the post-impressionist painters.
                
                Picasso was a prolific artist, creating thousands of works over his lifetime. He is best known for co-founding the Cubist movement, which was a major influence on modern art. Cubism is characterized by its abstract and geometric forms, which Picasso used to depict multiple viewpoints of a single object in a single painting.
                
                Picasso's works also included sculpture and printmaking. His sculptures often explored abstract forms and were made from a variety of materials including bronze, marble, and wood. He also created hundreds of prints in a variety of media including etchings, lithographs, and linocuts.
                
                Picasso's influence has been felt in many areas of modern art. His use of color and his exploration of the human form have been a major source of inspiration for many contemporary artists. His work has also had a major impact on the development of Pop Art in the mid-20th century.
                
                Despite his death in 1973, Picasso's legacy lives on through his artwork and its influence on modern art. He is widely considered to be one of the most important artists of the 20th century and his artwork continues to be celebrated around the world.</p>
